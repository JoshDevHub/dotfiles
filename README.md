# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Contains my configurations for the following tools:

- zsh
- alacritty
- starship
- tmux
- neovim
- i3
- picom

Also contains various scripts and aliases I like to use.

I manage my dotfiles using the [GNU Stow tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). **Highly** recommend it -- simplest solution I've found for organizing them.
